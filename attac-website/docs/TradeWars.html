Wars 2002 combines adventure and exploration with strategy and cooperative
play in an entertaining and exciting on-line game.&nbsp; You compete against
other BBSers to be the most powerful trader (or corporation of traders)
in the universe.&nbsp; Independent traders can compete quite effectively
against large corporations.&nbsp; Corporate members can perform specific
duties (as directed by their C.E.O.) in specialized ships.&nbsp; Traders
can be "good guys" or "bad guys" with different avenues for advancement.&nbsp;
The universe can be different with each new game.&nbsp; There is no right
or wrong way to play and the possible strategies are limited only by one's
imagination.</FONT></FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times"><FONT COLOR="#009900"><FONT SIZE=+1>When
you enter the game, you will be piloting a Merchant Cruiser.&nbsp; This
is considered the most versatile ship in the Trade Wars armada.&nbsp; In
it, new players have a chance to try out all aspects of the game.</FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times"><FONT COLOR="#009900"><FONT SIZE=+1>Upon
entering, you will be asked what alias you would like to use in the game
and what name you would like to christen your ship.&nbsp; The alias you
choose will display in the player and corporate rankings and in several
corporate listings.&nbsp; Your ship name will be used in the docking logs
at the ports.&nbsp; You can use these names to be as conspicuous or as
inconspicuous as you want.&nbsp; If your sysop has it configured this way,
you will also be given a personal planet when you enter the game.&nbsp;
You will be asked to name the planet here.&nbsp; You can then use option
<A HREF="CompDisplays.html#PersonalPlanets">&lt;Y> Your Personal Planets</A>
from the <A HREF="ComputerMenu.html">Computer Menu</A> to locate the planet.</FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times"><FONT COLOR="#009900"><FONT SIZE=+1>The
equipment in your initial ship will include some holds to store the cargo
that you can trade at the ports found throughout the universe.&nbsp; Trading
is the basic way to advance in the game.&nbsp; By good trading, you can
gain experience as well as gain credits.&nbsp; The credits you earn can
fund your military and can provide the capital you will need to expand
your trading expeditions.&nbsp; You will have some credits with which you
can purchase some commodities for trading.&nbsp; You will additionally
have some fighters to offer some protection as you begin your voyage.</FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times"><FONT COLOR="#009900"><FONT SIZE=+1>The
game will differ with each different group of players.&nbsp; Individual
traders are ranked by their experience.&nbsp; You gain experience simply
by playing the game.&nbsp; The more things you do, the more experience
you will get.&nbsp; Good and Evil are represented by the titles each player
receives.&nbsp; Your experience combined with your alignment will determine
whether you are a Lieutenant or a Dread Pirate.&nbsp; When you do something
that affects your alignment, you will get a message saying your alignment
went up or down and by how much.</FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times"><FONT COLOR="#009900"><FONT SIZE=+1>There
are benefits and drawbacks whether you choose to play the game as a good
trader or an evil trader.&nbsp; Traders who follow the FedLaws are offered
protection in FedSpace until they are experienced enough to protect themselves.&nbsp;
Traders who aspire to be very good can be awarded a Federal Commission.&nbsp;
This allows them to purchase an Imperial Starship.&nbsp; This is one of
the most powerful ships in the universe.&nbsp; On the other hand, the evil
traders are offered some options in the Underground.&nbsp; Traders who
have proved that they are truly evil can steal product or money from the
ports.</FONT></FONT></FONT>

<BR><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times"><FONT COLOR="#009900"><FONT SIZE=+1>You
will be traveling in a universe, whose size was determined by your SysOp.&nbsp;
Sectors may have planets, ports, other players, empty ships, aliens, Ferrengi,
Federation Starships, mines, message beacons, fighters (belonging to you,
other players, rogue mercenaries, or the Ferrengi) or the sectors may contain
nothing at all.&nbsp; If in your travels you come across something undesirable,
your initial ship comes equipped with 30 fighters with which you can defend
yourself.</FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times"><FONT COLOR="#009900"><FONT SIZE=+1>Many
players find it useful to have a home sector or group of sectors.&nbsp;
Players, especially those just joining a game, need an out-of-the-way place
to stay so they can build up their assets.&nbsp; You can explore the universe
and look for dead end sectors to use as a hiding place.&nbsp; Corporate
bases built in traffic lanes do not fare too well and those in the major
thoroughfares (in the paths between the class 0 and class 9 ports) just
do not stand much of a chance.</FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times"><FONT COLOR="#009900"><FONT SIZE=+1>Planets
play a key part in your success as a trader.&nbsp; Terra, the first planet
you encounter as you enter the game, is where the people can be found to
colonize all other planets.&nbsp; Remember, the environment on some planet
types may be hazardous to humans.&nbsp; The other planets in the game will,
if inhabited, produce Fuel Ore, Organics, Equipment and Fighters.&nbsp;
The amounts of these commodities produced will be affected by the type
of planet.&nbsp; For example, a Mountainous planet will provide more Fuel
Ore than an Oceanic planet.&nbsp; You and the other traders decide where
the planets will be.&nbsp; You can purchase a <A HREF="HardwareMenu.html#GenesisTorpedoes">Genesis
Torpedo</A> and use it in almost any sector in the galaxy.&nbsp; If the
planet has enough of the required commodities and enough people to supply
the labor to build it, you can begin construction of a <A HREF="PlanetMenu.html#EnterCitadel">Citadel</A>.&nbsp;
The Citadel can provide you and the other members of your corporation with
a secure place to dock your ships and deposit the credits you've earned.&nbsp;
As you progress in the game, your Citadel can be <A HREF="CitadelMenu.html#UpgradeCitadel">upgraded</A>
to provide additional protection to you and your corporation.&nbsp; If
you decide to build a planet in your home sector, be sure you can defend
it.&nbsp; A planet is very vulnerable until it has a Combat Control Computer
(level 2 Citadel) to safeguard it.</FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times"><FONT COLOR="#009900"><FONT SIZE=+1>There
are ten different types of ports scattered about the universe.&nbsp; The
ports are classified by the products they buy and/or sell.&nbsp; Port classes
1 through 8 trade the three basic commodities: Fuel Ore, Organics and Equipment.&nbsp;
The universe also contains specialty ports for the other items you will
need to advance in the game.&nbsp; There are three Class 0 ports where
you can purchase holds (beneficial for moving colonists to your planets
as well as transporting goods for trade), fighters (to help protect your
territory), or shields (to protect your ship from the traps laid by your
enemies).&nbsp; There is one Class 9 port that contains not only a Trading
Port, but also a <A HREF="StarDockMenu.html">StarDock</A>.&nbsp; The StarDock
houses the <A HREF="HardwareMenu.html">Stellar Hardware Emporium</A>, the
<A HREF="ShipyardMenu.html">Federation Shipyards</A>, the <A HREF="TavernMenu.html">Lost
Trader's Tavern</A>, the <A HREF="BankMenu.html">2nd National Galactic
Bank</A>, the <A HREF="StarDockMenu.html#CinePlexVideonTheatres">Videon
Cineplex</A> and the <A HREF="PoliceMenu.html">Interstellar Space Police
Headquarters</A>.&nbsp; There are other places of interest located in the
StarDock.&nbsp; These places you will have to discover on your own.&nbsp;
Some are not advertised because they are establishments of questionable
repute.&nbsp; Others are Federation buildings that house top secret government
information.</FONT></FONT></FONT>

large part of playing is interacting with others in the game.&nbsp; You
can mingle with other players in the <A HREF="TavernMenu.html">Lost Traders
Tavern</A>, gambling against them, conversing with them, leaving announcements
at the door or writing a message on the <A HREF="TavernMenu.html#UseTheFacilities">bathroom
wall</A>.&nbsp; You can combine your assets with other players of the same
alignment to <A HREF="CorporateMenu.html#MakeANewCorporation">form a Corporation</A>.&nbsp;
Just be aware that more than one Corporation has been brought down by a
con man who wormed his way into the Corporate structure.&nbsp; You can
have a chance encounter with other creatures of the universe, both real
(other users) and Non-Player Characters (the Federals, Alien traders and
the Ferrengi).&nbsp; Chance encounters offer many possibilities and can
advance you in your chosen career path.&nbsp; Your alignment and experience
and the alignment and experience of the creature you encounter will determine
just how that advancement if affected.</FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times"><FONT COLOR="#009900"><FONT SIZE=+1>Other
traders are users just like you.&nbsp; They have alignment and experience
points.&nbsp; You can see all the others by <A HREF="CompDisplays.html#ListTraderRank">Listing
Traders</A> from your ships computer.&nbsp; By using the listing, you can
see which players are good and which are evil.&nbsp; You can estimate whether
the other player would better serve your needs as an ally or adversary.</FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times"><FONT COLOR="#009900"><FONT SIZE=+1>The
Federation is the main governing body of the cosmos.&nbsp; You will meet
the Feds if you go to the <A HREF="PoliceMenu.html">Police Station</A>.&nbsp;
You might run into them as you roam around space.&nbsp; The Feds don't
look kindly on players who break FedLaws, so if you're not careful, they
might visit you when you least want their company.</FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times"><FONT COLOR="#009900"><FONT SIZE=+1>Alien
traders are visitors from another universe who are looking for better ports.&nbsp;
You can get a <A HREF="CompDisplays.html#AlienTraderRank">listing of the
Aliens</A> similar to the one you get for other traders.&nbsp; Aliens also
have experience and alignment, but you cannot form a Corporation with them.</FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times"><FONT COLOR="#009900"><FONT SIZE=+1>The
Ferrengi are a greedy, cowardly group.&nbsp; Their primary purpose is the
speedy acquisition of money.&nbsp; They will steal from anyone no matter
what the person's or corporation's alignment.&nbsp; They seldom engage
in face-to-face combat because they prefer the advantage of surprise when
ambushing their opponent.&nbsp; They often travel in groups and will spy
on promising territory.&nbsp; After targeting an area, they will raid the
sector when it is least defended.&nbsp; If they are attacked, that group
will hold a grudge against the attacker and they will not rest until they
feel the score has been settled.</FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times"><FONT COLOR="#009900"><FONT SIZE=+1>Explore
the universe and take part in the adventure.&nbsp; You can just look around
or you can become a dominant factor.&nbsp; Most of the displays are fully
