<p>&nbsp;: The new author of ATTAC (Zev Beckerman) has finished the version
that
<br>: is compatible with TWGS/TWv3. I offered to help get the word out
about
<br>: his new helper, but I haven't had time to put anything up on my web
site.
<br>: Until that time, I figured I'd just post an announcement on the forum.
<br>: If anyone has some positive feedback or constructive criticism, bug
reports
<br>: or whatever, post them. Zev reads the forum and I'm sure he'd appreciate
<br>: anything you have to say.
<p>: I'm glad to see other helpers coming online for TWGS/TWv3.
<p>: If you're interested in checking out the new helper, you can find
it at
<br>: www.tw-attac.com.
<p>: John Pritchett
<p>As a new person to this game, I've looked at all the helpers. I find
ATTAC the most user friendly and have decided to register it and have it
be my helper of choice. I know most use TWars, but while it looks impressive
I could not figure out several features and the constant pop-ups made it
near impossible and very annoying to try to evaluate. What all the helpers
need, is a more detailed manual or guide on their use. If they want to
capture new markets (newbies) these manuals should be geared to the beginner,
otherwise they are just competing for the small experienced players group.
