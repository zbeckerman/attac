v2 Helper</a> posted by John Pritchett (EIS) on October 06, 1999 at 12:18:04:
<p>&nbsp;: The new author of ATTAC (Zev Beckerman) has finished the version
that
<br>: is compatible with TWGS/TWv3. I offered to help get the word out
about
<br>: his new helper, but I haven't had time to put anything up on my web
site.
<br>: Until that time, I figured I'd just post an announcement on the forum.
<br>: If anyone has some positive feedback or constructive criticism, bug
reports
<br>: or whatever, post them. Zev reads the forum and I'm sure he'd appreciate
<br>: anything you have to say.
<p>And a mighty fine helper it is too (just had to throw that one in)!
<p>Seriously though, Zev has done an excellent job turning what was a pretty
<br>poor helper into a good and worthwhile product. If you haven't seen
ATTAC
<br>before or abandoned it in disgust back during the 1.0x series you really
<br>should download and check out version 2.01.
